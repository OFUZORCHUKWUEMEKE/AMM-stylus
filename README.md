# Basic Automated Market Maker built in Stylus



```bash
cargo stylus export-abi
```

which outputs:





```bash
cargo stylus check
```

If successful, you should see:

```bash
Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.88s
Reading WASM file at stylus-hello-world/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stylus-hello-world.wasm
Compressed WASM size: 8.9 KB
Program succeeded Stylus onchain activation checks with Stylus version: 1
```

Next, we can estimate the gas costs to deploy and activate our program before we send our transaction. Check out the [cargo-stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus) README to see the different wallet options for this step:

```bash
cargo stylus deploy \
  --private-key-path=<PRIVKEY_FILE_PATH> \
  --estimate-gas
```

You will then see the estimated gas cost for deploying before transacting:

```bash
Deploying program to address e43a32b54e48c7ec0d3d9ed2d628783c23d65020
Estimated gas for deployment: 1874876
```

The above only estimates gas for the deployment tx by default. To estimate gas for activation, first deploy your program using `--mode=deploy-only`, and then run `cargo stylus deploy` with the `--estimate-gas` flag, `--mode=activate-only`, and specify `--activate-program-address`.


Here's how to deploy:

```bash
cargo stylus deploy \
  --private-key-path=<PRIVKEY_FILE_PATH>
```

The CLI will send 2 transactions to deploy and activate your program onchain.
